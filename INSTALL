Installation instructions for LinkedData Extension v1.2
-------------------------------------------------------

In the following instructions we will use the abbreviation LDE for LinkedData 
Extension.


Requirements: 
=============

    MediaWiki 1.15.x
    SMW 1.5.x
    ScriptManager 1.x
    ARC Library 1.x
    Triple Store Connector with OntoBroker-Quad
    Deployment Framework (optional, but recommended for a fast and easy installation)

Installation:
=============

How to install with deployment framework:

(1) Download the Deployment Framework
(2) Extract the Deployment Framework zip-file into the MediaWiki roots folder
(3) Open the SMWAdministration tool
(4) Type 'smwadmin -i linkeddata'
    This installs the extension.

How to install manually:

(1) Install the ScriptManager and the ARCLibrary extension which you can find at
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/halo-extension/files/
(2) Activate the ScriptManager and the ARCLibrary extension by adding the
    following lines to LocalSettings.php. These lines should be placed before
    any other extension is loaded:
    require_once("extensions/ScriptManager/SM_Initialize.php");
	require_once("extensions/ARCLibrary/ARCLibrary.php");
    enableARCLibrary();
(3) Copy the folder 'LinkedData' into the extensions folder of MediaWiki.
(4) Activate the LDE by adding the following lines to LocalSettings.php:
	include_once('extensions/LinkedData/includes/LOD_Initialize.php');
	enableLinkedData(); 
	
(5) Install the patch for SMW. 

		Please find more detailed information about the patches at:
        http://smwforum.ontoprise.com/smwforum/index.php/Help:Installing_Linked_Data_extension#Notes_on_patches
            
        (a) Open a command-line interface in the root directory of the LDE to 
        	install the patches.
            The file patch_for_SMW1.5.6.txt is an Eclipse patch file which can 
            be installed using the tool patch.php which itself uses GNU patch. 
            Both tools are located in the root folder of the LDE.
        
        (b) Enter the following command:
             php patch.php -p patch_for_SMW1.5.6.txt -d <mw-dir> --onlypatch
             Replace <mw-dir> with the absolute path of your Mediawiki installation.

Updating the database
---------------------

The LDE requires some additional tables in the database that must
be added to the existing database schema. Existing data will not be modified.
Therefore change into the maintenance folder of the LDE and run the
setup script:
 cd /folder_to_mediawiki/extension/LinkedData/maintenance
 php LOD_Setup.php


Activating LDE
------------------

The extension is activated by adding the following lines to LocalSettings.php:

	include_once('extensions/LinkedData/includes/LOD_Initialize.php');
	enableLinkedData(); 


Installing TSC
-------------------
The LOD extension requires the TSC prof. version 1.5.1. It must be installed and
configured using the ontobroker-quad driver. 

1. Install TSC prof. 1.5.1

2. Goto to install-dir and type: 
        tsc.exe driver=ontobroker-quad 
        (you may create a shortcut for that)
        
3. Load a datasource description from a RDF file. 
   Add the additional commands in scripts/init.sample:
    
    DROP SILENT GRAPH <http://www.example.org/smw-lde/smwGraphs/DataSourceInformationGraph>
    CREATE SILENT GRAPH <http://www.example.org/smw-lde/smwGraphs/DataSourceInformationGraph>
    LOAD file://<your file>?format=<format> INTO <http://www.example.org/smw-lde/smwGraphs/DataSourceInformationGraph>
    
    Replace <your file> and <format> by proper values. <your file> can be a relative or absolute path.
    
4. Change to to directory wiki-dir/extensions/LinkedData/maintenance
    Type: LOD_importDatasources.php
    
    It should return with HTTP 200 status code.
